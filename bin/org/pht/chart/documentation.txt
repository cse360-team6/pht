-Included implementation of Bar and Pie charts (Area chart on the way)

-Pie chart provides current daily, weekly, and monthly views, as well as views for specific days, weeks, and months.

-Bar chart provides daily, weekly (total/days in to the week), and monthly (total/days in to the month) views. There is only the option to enter a specific date for the daily charts, as implementing specific weeks and months would take too long and extend past the first sprint.

-Charts may be added to any JFrame, but they have to be initialized on a JavaFX thread. I have included the main class which shows how this may be done.

-Definately needs formatting, but all of the methods work

-All of the functions accept an arraylist of either physical or health activity type. Because I made the activity panels poorly, there will need to be a panel for each type of information stored (i.e. cardio, strength, blood pressure, heart rate). The functions will search through said arraylist, find if they are within the corresponding day, week, or month, and then total the values of each, storing them in corresponding local variables for use in the charts. It is clunky, but it will work if the activities are handled in such a way.
